Buddy Suite is a set of applications for mobile phones, meant to enable friends to interact with each other in richer ways than afforded by default in a mobile phone. Buddy Suite has three main components:
  * _Friend Finder_ shows you on a map where your friends are currently located,
  * _Chess_ allows you to challenge your buddies to a "battle of the minds", and
  * _Smart Chat_ allows you to chat with your friends, even if you speak different languages.

The Buddy Suite started as a course project in EPFL's undergraduate [Software Engineering](http://sweng.epfl.ch/) course.
